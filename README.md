Weâ€™re going open source.

After a year of building Soul Agents, weâ€™re releasing our core repos under MIT:

âš¡ soulsync Â· frontend (Next.js + Privy integration)
ðŸ§  cryptobunny Â· backend (MongoDB, LangChain, X API + multi-model AI)

Weâ€™ll continue providing the UI interface, while inviting the community to contribute and help shape AI-native distribution.
